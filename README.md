## Lab 2: Responsive Web Page Design

**Contributor:** Munan Han

In this lab, I will build a simple website with a responsive (i.e., being able to change its layout based on the size of the screen) navigation bar. And I will practice writing code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then combine them together to create my own website based on my answers to lab 1.
